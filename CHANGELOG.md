## 3.1.0-beta | 2026-04-26

### Changed

- Version bumped from 3.0.0-beta to 3.1.0-beta across module manifest, entry scripts, and asset scripts.

### Fixed

- **Explorer file-extension toggle** (`Module/Regions/UIPersonalization/UIPersonalization.Explorer.psm1`) — `FileExtensions -Show`/`-Hide` no longer fails on fresh user profiles or `LocalSystem` execution contexts where `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced` does not yet exist. Both code paths now create the key with `New-Item -Force` when missing before writing `HideFileExt`. (#2)
- **GUI module load in bare shells** (`Module/GUICommon.psm1`) — `[System.Windows.Media.BrushConverter]::new()` was instantiated at module-load before any WPF assembly was loaded, throwing `TypeNotFound` in headless / integration-test PowerShell hosts. Added `Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationCore, PresentationFramework, WindowsBase -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` ahead of the instantiation so the WPF type system is available when `Import-Module Baseline` is run outside the embedded launcher. (#3)
- **DispatcherTimer null-pump crash on cleanup** (`Module/GUI/ExecutionOrchestration.ps1`) — the run timer's `Add_Tick` handler invoked `$Script:ExecutionPumpTickFn` by reference. If a tick fired after cleanup cleared the script-scope variable, the dispatcher threw `Cannot invoke null`. The handler now captures the function in a local closure (`$executionPumpTickFn = $Script:ExecutionPumpTickFn` + `.GetNewClosure()`) so any in-flight tick after cleanup still resolves to the original scriptblock and exits cleanly. (#4)
- **HKCU subkey-guard sweep across 14 region modules** — all bare `New-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\..."` writes that targeted subkeys not guaranteed to exist on fresh user profiles or under `LocalSystem` were converted to the existing `Set-RegistryValueSafe` helper (`Module/SharedHelpers/Registry.Helpers.ps1`), which internally creates the parent key with `New-Item -Force` when missing. Affected files: `Module/Regions/UIPersonalization/UIPersonalization.Explorer.psm1` (37 sites: 13 to `Explorer\Advanced`, 6 to `Explorer\ControlPanel`, 2 to `Explorer\OperationStatusManager`, plus base-key writes) (#5); `Module/Regions/UIPersonalization/UIPersonalization.Appearance.psm1` (4 sites: `Explorer\Advanced\DisallowShaking`, `Themes\Personalize\AppsUseLightTheme`) (#6); `Module/Regions/UIPersonalization/UIPersonalization.Icons.psm1` (6 sites: `Explorer\Advanced\SnapAssist`, `Themes\Personalize\SystemUsesLightTheme`, `Explorer\StuckRects3\Settings`) (#7); `Module/Regions/UIPersonalization/UIPersonalization.Taskbar.psm1` (TaskbarAl, SearchboxTaskbarMode, IsDynamicSearchBoxEnabled, ShowTaskViewButton, TaskbarGlomLevel, ShowCopilotButton, TaskbarCompanion, TaskbarEndTask) plus a parent-side `Test-Path`/`New-Item` guard before the `& powershell_temp.exe -Command {…}` subshell since the subshell cannot see `Set-RegistryValueSafe` (#8); `Module/Regions/StartMenu.psm1` (5 sites: `Start_AccountNotifications`, `Start_IrisRecommendations`, `Start_Layout`) (#9); `Module/Regions/Taskbar.psm1` plus a parent-side guard before the `Invoke-UCPDBypassed -ScriptBlock {…}` wrapper for the same reason (#10); `Module/Regions/TaskbarClock.psm1` (4 sites: `ShowClockInNotificationCenter`, `ShowSecondsInSystemClock`) (#11); `Module/Regions/Cursors.psm1` (59 sites under `HKCU:\Control Panel\Cursors` — largest single offender) (#12); `Module/Regions/Gaming.psm1` (2 sites: `GameBar\ShowStartupPanel`) (#13); `Module/Regions/ContextMenu.psm1` (1 site: `MultipleInvokePromptMinimum`) (#14); `Module/Regions/Defender/Defender.CoreProtection.psm1` (2 sites: `Windows Security Health\State\AccountProtection_MicrosoftAccount_Disconnected`, `AppAndBrowser_EdgeSmartScreenOff`) (#15); `Module/Regions/PrivacyTelemetry/PrivacyTelemetry.TelemetryServices.psm1` (3 sites: `DiagTrack\ShowedToastAtLevel`, `Windows Error Reporting\Disabled`) (#16); `Module/Regions/PrivacyTelemetry/PrivacyTelemetry.PrivacySettings.psm1` (3 sites: `AdvertisingInfo\Enabled`, `HttpAcceptLanguageOptOut`) (#17); `Module/Regions/PrivacyTelemetry/PrivacyTelemetry.SystemSettings.psm1` (2 sites: `TailoredExperiencesWithDiagnosticDataEnabled`) (#18). All sites that already used inline `Test-Path`/`New-Item` guards were left unchanged.
- **Swallowed exceptions in actionable startup paths** — `catch { $null = $_ }` blocks around `Initialize-GuiDetectCache`, `Initialize-BaselineUserPreferences`, `Initialize-NewBadgeService`, and the GUI version-detection regex now emit `LogWarning` with the underlying `Exception.Message` so first-launch initialization failures surface in the daily log instead of being silently dropped. Cleanup/dispose paths (timer stops, dispatcher invocations, splash window close) remain silent because their exceptions are non-actionable. (#19)
- **Popup pickers for UWP Apps, Windows Features (capabilities + features), and Scheduled Tasks** (`Module/Regions/UWPApps.psm1`, `Module/Regions/System/System.WindowsFeatures.psm1`, `Module/Regions/PrivacyTelemetry/PrivacyTelemetry.TelemetryServices.psm1`) — picker windows did not call `Set-GuiWindowChromeTheme` after loading their XAML, so the OS-drawn title bar stayed on the default light Windows chrome regardless of the GUI's current theme. In dark mode this produced the visual mismatch the rest of the GUI did not show (every other dialog already routed through this helper). All 5 picker XAML loads now invoke `Set-GuiWindowChromeTheme` against `$Script:CurrentThemeName` immediately after `XamlReader.Load`, behind a `Get-Command` guard so it no-ops if the helper isn't loaded in a child runspace. (#1)

### Fixed

- GUI window no longer overflows screen on high-DPI displays due to missing DPI awareness
