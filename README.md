## What is Baseline?

Baseline is a PowerShell-based Windows utility focused on transparency, safety, and repeatable configuration.

Instead of running opaque tweak bundles, Baseline shows:
- what will change
- what risk level applies
- whether a restart is required
- how recovery works where possible

Baseline includes:
- a modern WPF GUI
- manifest-backed tweak metadata
- preset-driven workflows
- Preview Run planning
- Windows Update management
- gaming profiles
- software management
- Windows setup media tooling
- headless automation support

---

## Supported platforms

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| Windows 10 x64 | Supported |
| Windows 11 | Supported |
| Windows 11 ARM64 | Supported |
| Windows 10 LTSC 2019 | Supported |
| Windows 11 LTSC 2024 | Supported |
| Windows Server 2016–2025 | Best effort / untested |

PowerShell 5.1 is required.

## Why Baseline is different

Most Windows tweak tools expose little or no metadata about what they change.

Baseline is designed differently:

- **Preview-first execution** — review planned changes before applying them
- **Manifest-backed tweaks** — risk labels, restart requirements, reversibility, and recovery guidance are stored as metadata
- **Preset semantics** — `Minimal`, `Basic`, `Balanced`, and `Advanced` are intentionally scoped instead of acting as a single “run everything” button
- **Structured results** — execution summaries, logs, and recovery hints remain visible after runs
- **Separated workflows** — optimization, gaming, updates, apps, and deployment remain isolated instead of mixed together
- **Headless support** — automation and scripted deployment are supported without the GUI

---

## Presets

Recommended starting point: **Basic**

Safe Mode beginner starting point: **Minimal**

| Preset | Intended for | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Minimal | Safe Mode beginners | Conservative maintenance and quality-of-life changes |
| Basic | Most users | Lower-risk cleanup, usability, and privacy improvements |
| Balanced | Enthusiasts | Broader privacy, performance, and configuration changes |
| Advanced | Experienced users only | Higher-impact tuning, debloat, and hardening |

> `Advanced` is not the “best” preset. It is the expert preset and should only be used by users who understand the compatibility and recovery tradeoffs involved.

## Installation

Download the latest release from GitHub Releases.

### Beta releases
- `Baseline-<version>-beta.zip`

### Stable releases
- `Baseline-<version>-stable.zip`

The archive contains:
- `Baseline-<version>-setup.exe`

Current 4.x preview releases are unsigned, so Windows SmartScreen may display a warning on first launch.

To continue:
1. Click **More info**
2. Click **Run anyway**

Optional SHA-256 verification:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\Baseline-<version>.zip -Algorithm SHA256
```

---

## Quick start

### Beginner workflow

1. Launch Baseline
2. Select `Minimal` or `Basic`
3. Click `Preview Run`
4. Review planned changes
5. Click `Apply Tweaks`
6. Restart if prompted

---

## Command-line examples

### Launch GUI

```powershell
.\Baseline.exe
```

### Apply preset

```powershell
.\Baseline.exe -Preset Basic
```

### Dry run

```powershell
.\Baseline.exe -Preset Balanced -DryRun
```

### Apply configuration profile

```powershell
.\Baseline.exe -ProfilePath .\baseline-profile.json
```

### Export a first-logon command for autounattend

Export a configuration profile from the GUI, then use the first-logon command export to create a `FirstLogonCommands` XML snippet. The generated command runs `Baseline.exe --configfile "<profile.json>" --apply` during Windows setup first logon.

### Compliance check

```powershell
.\Baseline.exe -ComplianceCheck -ProfilePath .\baseline-profile.json
```

### Interactive console mode

```powershell
.\Baseline.exe -ConsoleGui
```

- preset validation
- contract tests
- smoke tests
- integration testing

Desktop-specific validation is performed on real Windows environments where required.

---

## Known limitations

- Remote execution is advanced/experimental and should not be treated as a replacement for enterprise device-management tooling.
- Managed or domain-enrolled systems may enforce policies that override Baseline behavior.
- Some changes may still require restore points or manual recovery.

---

## FAQ

### Which preset should I start with?

`Basic` is recommended for most users. In Safe Mode, start with `Minimal`.

### Should I use `Advanced`?

Only if you understand the compatibility, hardening, and recovery implications involved.

### Can Baseline automatically undo everything?

No. Some actions are reversible, some restore Windows defaults, and some may require manual recovery or restore points.

### Does Baseline support unattended automation?

Yes. Presets, profiles, dry-runs, and compliance checks all support headless execution.

---

## Disclaimer

- Review changes before applying them.
- Create a restore point before higher-impact changes.
- Work, school, domain, or MDM-managed devices should be reviewed with the appropriate administrator before use.
- Third-party security suites and OEM modifications may affect behavior.
